Gameplay

    The game randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.
    The word is displayed with underscores representing each letter.
    Enter a letter in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
    If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
    If the letter is incorrect, part of the hangman will be drawn/cut off.
    Continue guessing letters until the word is completed or the hangman is fully drawn.
    After each round, you will be prompted to play again.
